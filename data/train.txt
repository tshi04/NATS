'' here , inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they 're ready to appear in court . most often , they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer -- charges that judge steven leifman says are usually `` avoidable felonies . '' he says the arrests often result from confrontations with police . mentally ill people often wo n't do what they 're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid , delusional , and less likely to follow directions , according to leifman . so , they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed , but not getting any real help because they 're in jail . we toured the jail with leifman . he is well known in miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill . even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards , we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor . go inside the ` forgotten floor ' '' at first , it 's hard to determine where the people are . the prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes . imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that 's kind of what they look like . they 're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves . that 's also why they have no shoes , laces or mattresses . leifman says about one-third of all people in miami-dade county jails are mentally ill . so , he says , the sheer volume is overwhelming the system , and the result is what we see on the ninth floor . of course , it is a jail , so it 's not supposed to be warm and comforting , but the lights glare , the cells are tiny and it 's loud . we see two , sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes , sometimes naked , lying or sitting in their cells . `` i am the son of the president . you need to get me out of here ! '' one man shouts at me . he is absolutely serious , convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the white house . leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system , occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital , only to return to jail to face their charges . it 's brutally unjust , in his mind , and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in miami . over a meal later , we talk about how things got this way for mental patients . leifman says 200 years ago people were considered `` lunatics '' and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them . they were just considered unfit to be in society . over the years , he says , there was some public outcry , and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals . but leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down . where did the patients go ? nowhere . the streets . they became , in many cases , the homeless , he says . they never got treatment . leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals , and today that number has been reduced 90 percent , and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals . the judge says he 's working to change this . starting in 2008 , many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the `` forgotten floor '' will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment , not just punishment . leifman says it 's not the complete answer , but it 's a start . leifman says the best part is that it 's a win-win solution . the patients win , the families are relieved , and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again . and , for leifman , justice is served . e-mail to a friend .

'' the suspension makes `` a strong statement that conduct which tarnishes the good reputation of the nfl will not be tolerated , '' he said in a statement . watch what led to vick 's suspension '' goodell said the falcons could `` assert any claims or remedies '' to recover $ 22 million of vick 's signing bonus from the 10-year , $ 130 million contract he signed in 2004 , according to the associated press . vick said he would plead guilty to one count of `` conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in an animal fighting venture '' in a plea agreement filed at u.s. district court in richmond , virginia . the charge is punishable by up to five years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine , `` full restitution , a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release , '' the plea deal said . federal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines . `` the defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense , '' the plea agreement said . in an additional summary of facts , signed by vick and filed with the agreement , vick admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs , but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won . `` most of the ` bad newz kennels ' operations and gambling monies were provided by vick , '' the official summary of facts said . gambling wins were generally split among co-conspirators tony taylor , quanis phillips and sometimes purnell peace , it continued . `` vick did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights . vick did not receive any of the proceeds from the purses that were won by ` bad newz kennels .

' '' in the plea deal , vick agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary . vick also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests . vick agreed to `` make restitution for the full amount of the costs associated '' with the dogs that are being held by the government . `` such costs may include , but are not limited to , all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case , including if necessary , the long-term care and/or the humane euthanasia of some or all of those animals . '' prosecutors , with the support of animal rights activists , have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs . but the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against vick and his admitted co-conspirators . judge henry e. hudson issued an order thursday telling the u.s. marshals service to `` arrest and seize the defendant property , and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant property . '' both the judge 's order and vick 's filing refer to `` approximately '' 53 pit bull dogs . after vick 's indictment last month , goodell ordered the quarterback not to report to the falcons training camp , and the league is reviewing the case . blank told the nfl network on monday he could not speculate on vick 's future as a falcon , at least not until he had seen `` a statement of facts '' in the case . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's mike phelan contributed to this report .

'' the white house is billing the speech , along with another address next week to the american legion , as an effort to `` provide broader context '' for the debate over the upcoming iraq progress report by gen. david petraeus , the top u.s. military commander , and ryan crocker , the u.s. ambassador in baghdad . president bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the american people -- to withhold judgment on his troop `` surge '' in iraq until the report comes out in september . watch bush criticize the iraqi government '' it is being closely watched on capitol hill , particularly by republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war . earlier this month , defense secretary robert gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 u.s. troops in iraq might begin . bush 's speeches wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the white house to try to reframe the debate over iraq , as public support for the war continues to sag . a recent cnn/opinion research corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the iraq war , and 72 percent say that even if petraeus reports progress , it wo n't change their opinion . the poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report ; 53 percent said they do not trust petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in iraq . in addition to his analogy to vietnam , bush in wednesday 's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from asia , including the u.s. defeat and occupation of japan after world war ii and the korean war in the 1950s , according to the excerpts . `` in the aftermath of japan 's surrender , many thought it naive to help the japanese transform themselves into a democracy . then , as now , the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom , '' bush will say . `` today , in defiance of the critics , japan ... stands as one of the world 's great free societies . '' speaking about the korean war , bush will note that at the time `` critics argued that the war was futile , that we never should have sent our troops in , or that america 's intervention was divisive here at home . '' `` while it is true that the korean war had its share of challenges , america never broke its word , '' bush will say . `` without america 's intervention during the war , and our willingness to stick with the south koreans after the war , millions of south koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime .

'' this could explain why bees in australia may be resistant to colony collapse . `` there are no cases ... in australia at all , '' entomologist dave britton of the australian museum told the sydney morning herald last month . `` it is a northern hemisphere phenomenon . '' bee ecology expert and university of florida professor jamie ellis said earlier this year that genetic weakness bred into bees over time , pathogens spread by parasites and the effects of pesticides and pollutants might be other factors . researchers also say varroa mites affect all hives on the u.s. mainland but are not found in australia . university of georgia bee researcher keith s. delaplane said thursday the study offers a warning -- and hope . `` one nagging problem has been a general inability to treat or vaccinate bees against viruses of any kind , '' said delaplane , who has been trying to breed bees resistant to the varroa mite . `` but in the case of iapv , there is evidence that some bees carry genetic resistance to the disorder . this is yet one more argument for beekeepers to use honey bee stocks that are genetically disease - and pest-resistant . '' bee researchers will now look for stresses that may combine to kill bees . `` the next step is to ascertain whether iapv , alone or in concert with other factors , can induce ccd -lsb- colony collapse disorder -rsb- in healthy bees , '' said ian lipkin , director of the center for infection and immunity at columbia university mailman school of public health . besides the columbia and usda researchers , others involved in the study released thursday include researchers from pennsylvania state university , the pennsylvania department of agriculture , the university of arizona and 454 life sciences . e-mail to a friend .

<s> because of troubles , lindsay lohan likely difficult to insure . </s> <s> lohan supposed to appear in shirley maclaine film `` poor things '' </s> <s> insurance rates may cost 1 to 3 percent of film 's production budget . </s><sec>los angeles , california -lrb- reuters -rrb- -- `` to insure or not to insure ? '' it is n't shakespeare , but it is the dramatic question hollywood filmmakers are asking about lindsay lohan following her legal troubles this week . lindsay lohan may still get work after her legal problems are settled , but the cost will be high . it is an important question , too , because whether companies insure lohan 's future movies may determine whether she will quickly fall off hollywood 's a-list . but lohan fans have little to fear because no actor is uninsurable , say underwriting experts . while some producers may balk at conditions for hiring problematic stars , experts say that unless an actor is serving time in prison , even the most volatile can be covered -- albeit at a high cost . `` for a price , anything can be done , although an insurance carrier can make things so unpalatable that at times the makers of the film just wo n't be interested , '' said ross miller , partner with insurance brokerage d.r. reiff & associates inc. . lohan 's arrest this week in los angeles on suspicion of drunken driving and cocaine possession has left hollywood wondering if the actress , who shot to fame as a child in disney films like `` the parent trap , '' is too risky to cast in a film . timeline : lindsay lohan 's troubles '' it remains to be seen whether her latest relapse and brush with the law will cost her a role in `` poor things , '' a film produced by and starring oscar-winner shirley maclaine . see a gallery of lohan 's films '' a statement was expected early next week on whether the movie , already delayed this spring due to an earlier rehab stint by lohan , will proceed with or without her . insurance experts say the industry has long dealt with similar situations , although they may seem more frequent with the recent heavy media scrutiny of lohan and fellow troubled party girls paris hilton and britney spears . `` i do n't think it -lrb- a problematic artist -rrb- is any more of an issue , '' said wendy diaz , entertainment underwriting director at fireman 's fund insurance co. , the leading film underwriter . `` it 's pretty standard year to year . '' but diaz did say the terms for covering lohan would likely be `` serious at this point . '' she said fireman 's fund , in such a case , would likely put in higher deductibles , or ask the star to put their salary into escrow to pay for any losses if production was disrupted . last july , a producer on lohan 's last film , `` georgia rule , '' scolded her publicly for repeatedly showing up late on the set , costing the movie 's makers hundreds of thousands of dollars . brian kingman , a managing director with entertainment insurance broker aon/albert g. ruben said covering situations like lohan 's required a lot of calculation and risk management . insurance rates for errant actors can range anywhere from 1 percent to 3 percent of a movie 's production budget , which can range from $ 5 million to $ 100 million or more , he said . `` filmmakers fall in love with certain actors for certain roles and my job is to find risk-takers to take on the risk , '' kingman said . he said actors were always required to undergo a medical exam before getting insurance . in certain circumstances , drug screening is conducted and actors are required to provide blood and urine samples . in cases of known drug abuse , `` minders '' are sometimes required on set to keep an eye on the actor . kingman said he had even helped craft policies for actors in the event they risked the possibility of incarceration . `` i have been successful in finding and creating incarceration coverage for certain actors on probation which can be revoked if they break certain rules , '' he said , citing the case of robert downey jr. , another high-profile star with a history of legal , drug and alcohol problems . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .
<s> several famous songs written by men for a woman . </s> <s> beethoven 's `` für elise '' may have been written `` for therese '' </s> <s> songwriters make up stories about who is behind `` 867-5309 / jenny '' </s><sec>1 . `` für elise '' bob dylan wrote `` it ai n't me , babe '' for joan baez . written by : ludwig van beethoven . written for : some girl probably not named elise . in fact , as far as most historians can tell , beethoven did n't even know an elise . instead , the song was originally titled `` bagatelle in a minor '' based on some handwritten notation a beethoven researcher claimed to have seen on a now-lost copy of the sheet music . further complicating things , beethoven had hideous handwriting -- to the point that some scholars speculate the song was actually written `` for therese , '' as in therese malfatti , one of several women who turned down a marriage proposal from the notoriously lovesick maestro . 2 . `` philadelphia freedom '' written by : elton john & bernie taupin . written for : billie jean king , as a thank-you for a tracksuit she gave elton . and what a tracksuit it must have been ! the 1975 song remains one of the most popular disco hits ever , leaving thousands of hustle enthusiasts wondering just what billie jean king had to do with philadelphia , anyway . turns out , the song was a reference to king 's pro tennis team , the philadelphia freedoms . prior to 1968 , tennis players were all considered `` amateurs '' and were n't eligible to receive prize money . so , if you did n't have the wealth to support yourself , you could n't play . billie jean king fought against those constraints , ultimately founding professional world team tennis in 1974 and turning tennis into a paid league sport . 3 . `` lola '' written by : the kinks ' ray davies . written for : a transvestite . but the question is , which one ? according to rolling stone , `` lola '' was inspired by candy darling , a member of andy warhol 's entourage , whom ray davies briefly -lrb- and cluelessly -rrb- dated . if that 's the case , then `` lola '' is just another notch on darling 's song belt -- she 's also referred to in lou reed 's `` walk on the wild side . '' -lrb- `` candy came from out on the island / in the backroom she was everybody 's darlin ' . '' -rrb- . but , in the kinks ' official biography , davies tells a different story . he says `` lola '' was written after the band 's manager spent a very drunken night dancing with a woman whose five o'clock shadow was apparently obvious to everyone but him . 4 . `` 867-5309 / jenny '' written by : jim keller -lrb- of tommy tutone -rrb- and alex call . written for : unknown , as the songwriters apparently make up a different story about its inspiration every time they 're asked . while the woman continues to remain a mystery , however , the phone number is all too real . in fact , it 's been wreaking havoc ever since 1982 and the passage of time has n't quelled of the number of crank calls . in 1999 , brown university freshman roommates nina clemente and jahanaz mirza found that out the hard way , when the school adopted an 867 exchange number for its on-campus phone system . immediately , the girls ' innocuous room no. 5309 became a magnet for every drunk college kid with a 1980s fetish . other unfortunate phone customers have fought back with creative and profitable solutions , like the holder of 212-867-5309 , who put his phone number up for auction on ebay in 2004 . bids approached $ 100,000 before ebay pulled the item at the request of verizon , the number 's actual owner . 5 . `` oh , carol '' written by : neil sedaka . written for : carole king , naturally . sedaka and king actually dated briefly in high school -- a romance sedaka was able to successfully milk with `` oh , carol , '' a then top-10 -lrb- if now somewhat forgettable -rrb- 1959 pop song . however , the real success of `` oh , carol '' came a few months later , when it inspired king to write a rebuttal entitled `` oh , neil . '' at the time , king and her husband , gerry goffin , were fledgling songwriters in need of a hit tune . `` oh , neil '' was n't that , but it did pay off . after sedaka gave a tape of the song to his boss , king and goffin landed jobs at the legendary brill building pop music factory , where the duo went on to write chart-toppers like `` will you still love me tomorrow '' and `` the loco-motion . '' 6 . `` it ai n't me , babe '' written by : bob dylan . written for : joan baez , though it clearly was n't the nicest gift dylan could have given her . the two met in 1961 , when baez was an up-and-coming folk singer and dylan was a nobody from minnesota . desperate to make his break in the music biz , dylan worked like crazy to get baez 's attention . he eventually ended up going on tour with her , which is how he first became famous , and also how the two began dating . for a while , they seemed like the golden couple , but things soon went downhill . during a european concert tour together in early 1965 , they had a huge fight and parted ways . that may , dylan was holed up in a hotel after being hospitalized with a virus , and baez , hoping to remain friends , decided to bring him flowers . sadly , that 's how she found out that her ex was already dating someone else . that someone else was sara lownds , whom dylan married a mere six months later . 7 . `` our house '' written by : graham nash -lrb- of crosby , stills , nash & young -rrb- . written for : joni mitchell . in december 1968 , nash and mitchell moved into a cozy little house in the laurel canyon section of los angeles . though commonly left out of the hippy pantheon , laurel canyon was sort of a commune-home away from commune-home for san francisco society -- not just csn&y , but also jim morrison , the eagles , frank zappa , and more . `` our house '' was directly inspired by a lazy sunday in the nash/mitchell household . the couple went out to brunch , hit an antiques store , and then returned to find the house just a bit chilly , at which point nash literally `` lit a fire , '' while mitchell `` placed the flowers in the vase that she bought that day . '' no , really . the whole tableau seemed so ridiculously domestic to nash that he immediately sat down and spent the rest of the day writing about it . e-mail to a friend .

'' spider-man said after the boy mimicked his wrist movement . other superheroes crowded around to get a closer look . even the green goblin stopped his villainous ways to tell the boy hi . youssif remained unfazed . he did n't take a liking to spider-man 's nemesis . spidey was just too cool . `` it was my favorite thing , '' the boy said later . `` i want to see him again . '' he then felt compelled to add : `` i know it 's not the real spider-man . '' this was the day of dreams when the boy 's nightmares were , at least temporarily , forgotten . he met spongebob , lassie and a 3-year-old orangutan named archie . the hairy , brownish-red primate took to the boy , grabbing his hand and holding it . even when youssif pulled away , archie would inch his hand back toward the boy 's and then snatch it . see youssif enjoy being a boy again '' the boy giggled inside a play area where sponge-like balls shot out of toy guns . it was a far different artillery than what he was used to seeing in central baghdad , as recently as a week ago . he squealed with delight and raced around the room collecting as many balls as he could . he rode a tram through the back stages at universal studios . at one point , the car shook . fire and smoke filled the air , debris cascaded down and a big rig skidded toward the vehicle . the boy and his family survived the pretend earthquake unscathed . `` even i was scared , '' the dad said . `` well , i was n't , '' youssif replied . the father and mother grinned from ear to ear throughout the day . youssif pushed his 14-month-old sister , ayaa , in a stroller . `` did you even need to ask us if we were interested in coming here ?

'' nichols responded , `` that is what we believe , yes . '' watch simpson transferred sunday in handcuffs '' the alleged victims were identified as bruce fromong , a sports memorabilia collector who described the incident as `` a home invasion-type robbery , '' and alfred beardsley , who has been quoted by celebrity web site tmz.com as saying that simpson later apologized to him and told him he regretted the incident . acting on a tip , police met over the weekend at mccarran international airport with 46-year-old walter alexander , of mesa , arizona , who told them about the alleged robbery and validated the tipster 's information , capt. james dillon told reporters . alexander was arrested saturday night on two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon , two counts of assault with a deadly weapon , conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary with a deadly weapon . he was released on his own recognizance and returned to mesa either saturday night or early sunday morning , dillon said . in addition , investigators are seeking four other men they believe accompanied simpson into the hotel room , nichols said . nichols said , `` there is a social relationship between the individuals that we identified and o.j. simpson . '' though simpson is not accused of having brandished a gun himself , two firearms that police said were used were recovered early sunday in one of three searches . investigators would would not divulge where the weapons were found . nichols dismissed an initial report that the men may have been off-duty police . `` there is no truth to that whatsoever , '' he said . `` that came as a result of some language that was used when the individuals burst into the room that led our victims to believe that they may have been police . '' simpson , 60 , has acknowledged taking some items that belonged to him , but he has denied that any weapons were involved . `` whether the property belonged to mr. simpson or not is still in debate , '' nichols said . `` we are still in the process of sorting that out . '' nichols also said that some of the property taken had simpson 's signature . but `` there was some other property taken as well , '' he said . `` i believe there were some joe montana cleats and some signed baseballs and other stuff . '' the latest charges against simpson mean he faces the prospect of another prosecution , more than a decade after the june 1994 stabbing deaths of his ex-wife , nicole brown simpson , and ron goldman . simpson was acquitted of murder the following year . the trial riveted much of the united states . but in 1997 , a jury found him liable for the deaths in a civil case brought by the goldman family . simpson was ordered to pay the families a total of $ 33.5 million for the deaths . goldman had gone to nicole simpson 's los angeles home to return a pair of glasses the day of the slayings . goldman 's sister , kim goldman , said she was n't surprised by the robbery allegations , since simpson `` thinks he can do no wrong . '' `` he 's capable of stabbing people to death , so i think robbery is nothing surprising , '' she said . `` normal , logical , civil-minded , law-abiding people do n't storm a room with guns demanding stuff back . '' fromong had testified on simpson 's behalf in the civil case , telling the court that prices for simpson memorabilia had dropped substantially since the 1995 verdict . his testimony was part of the defense 's contention that simpson could not afford to pay the goldmans . simpson recently wrote a book originally titled `` if i did it '' and had planned to publish it himself , but a public outcry led to the cancellation of his book deal . a bankruptcy judge subsequently awarded the goldmans the rights to the book in light of their inability to collect the wrongful death award . the goldmans retitled the book , `` if i did it : confessions of the killer .

'' the transfer took place january 26 , the indictment alleges . oakley is also charged with converting the material and `` restricted data '' to his own use . he began doing so on about october 17 , 2006 , and continued through january , prosecutors said . prosecutors said the materials involved have been examined by scientists and posed no threat to people who may have come into contact with them . oakley 's attorney , herb moncier , said outside court thursday that oakley 's job was to break rods `` into little pieces '' and throw them away . moncier said oakley had a security clearance , but moncier did not believe it was a high-level clearance . the government alleges that in january , oakley attempted to sell the `` pieces of scrap '' to someone he thought was a french agent -- but in reality was an undercover fbi agent , moncier said . he said he questions whether those broken pieces would be considered an `` appliance '' under the law . `` mr. oakley has cooperated fully for the last six months , '' said moncier , who added that he had traveled to washington for work on the case . each count carries a possible sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine . `` while none of the stolen equipment was ever transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization , the facts of this case demonstrate the importance of safeguarding our nuclear technology and pursuing aggressive prosecution against those who attempt to breach the safeguards and put that technology in the wrong hands , '' kenneth wainstein , assistant attorney general for national security , said in the justice department statement . one government source said the materials involved are not the `` crown jewels , '' but they should not have been taken from the facility . a `` barrier '' is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process , according to nuclear energy officials , but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job . sources told cnn that federal authorities have been following oakley and investigating the case for at least six months , after he allegedly tried to sell the classified material . oakley , described as a low-level employee , apparently did not make contact with any foreign government and is not a foreign agent of any kind , an official familiar with the case said . a government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of oakley 's alleged intentions six months ago , the fbi and department of energy launched a joint investigation . the fbi then developed a sting operation , government officials familiar with the case said , and authorities intervened before there could be any involvement of a foreign country . east tennessee technology park is an area of the doe 's oak ridge reservation `` where we are currently decontaminating and decommissioning buildings that were last used in 1985 , '' gerald boyd , manager of the doe 's oak ridge site office , said thursday . `` when they were in use , now over 20 years ago , some of the buildings at ettp housed facilities used for the enrichment of uranium .

<s> organ shortage in rich states has created a trade from poorer countries . </s> <s> `` transplant tourists '' travel to poor countries to buy organs from the desperate . </s> <s> pakistan , where trade in human organs is legal , is turning into a `` kidney bazaar '' </s> <s> patients pay $ 8,500 for a new kidney , while donors are paid just $ 300 to $ 1,000 . </s><sec>hong kong , china -lrb- reuters -rrb- -- paul lee got his liver from an executed chinese prisoner ; karam in egypt bought a kidney for his sister for $ 5,300 ; in istanbul hakan is holding out for $ 30,700 for one of his kidneys . doctors in pakistan have been arrested for abducting people , drugging them and stealing their kidneys . they are not so unusual : a dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries is sending foreigners with end-stage illnesses to poorer places like china , pakistan , turkey , egypt , colombia and the philippines to buy a new lease of life . lee , a 53-year-old chief subway technician in hong kong , was diagnosed with liver cancer in january 2005 but doctors denied him a transplant because they feared the tumor would spread . a friend told him about a transplant hospital in china 's north eastern tianjin city and he signed up for a place . that april , he paid 260,000 yuan -lrb- $ 34,380 -rrb- for a transplant -- surgery that saved his life . `` the hospital has connections with a lot of prisons , '' lee told reuters . `` mine came from an executed prisoner from heilongjiang . i thank the donor deeply . '' the world health organization estimates that 21,000 liver transplants are carried out annually , but medical experts put annual worldwide demand at at least 90,000 . demand for kidneys also exceeds supply , and that has given rise to organ trafficking and a black market for rich people and `` transplant tourists '' who travel to poor countries to buy body parts from people with few other routes to a better living . a donor in south africa receives $ 700 for a kidney compared with $ 30,000 in the united states . a lack of transparency and little protection for donors has spurred calls by international bodies to crack down on , or at least regulate , the trade . but even where the trade is banned , laws are often muddled or laced with loopholes , which are sometimes defended by vested interests . and the unregulated route is much less complicated for the recipient . any transplant procedure involving a living donor carries risks for the donor -- especially for liver transplants which involve removing part of the donor 's liver . the complications can include bleeding , infection , even death . in the transplant trade , the recipient need not worry about , for example , exposing a living relative to that risk . `` it is cheaper and your next of kin is not taking the risk and you do n't have to care for someone you do n't know . once you pay , it is discarded in a way , it is dispensable , '' said luc noel , a geneva-based coordinator for clinical procedures at the world health organization . china recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted transplants for foreigners , saying it must first meet demand at home for 2 million organs a year . only 20,000 transplants are carried out in china each year . of these , 3,000 are liver transplants and 95 percent of them use livers from dead donors . china defended its use of organs from executed prisoners , saying consent was obtained from convicts or their families . a transplant operation using the liver of a dead donor costs around $ 33,000 in china . `` what is important is the transparency , it has to be open to scrutiny ... if china makes its current system open to scrutiny and very transparent , that would do good , '' said the who 's noel . in asia , a cultural obsession with keeping the body of the deceased intact has stymied public organ donation programs . excluding china , asia has fewer than 200 livers donated by people ahead of their death each year , said lo chung-man , professor of hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery at the university of hong kong . pakistan , where trade in human organs is not illegal , is turning into a `` kidney bazaar '' , said the chief executive of pakistan 's kidney foundation , jaffar naqvi . there are no confirmed figures for the number of foreigners coming to the country for new kidneys but naqvi said there were 13 centers in lahore alone which reported more than 2,000 transplants last year from bought kidneys . patients , mostly from europe , saudi arabia and india , pay about 500,000 rupees -lrb- $ 8,500 -rrb- for a new kidney , he said . donors are paid $ 300 to $ 1,000 and often get no medical care after the surgery . there is no consent in some cases . in may police arrested nine people , four of them doctors , for abducting people , drugging them and stealing their kidneys for transplant operations . in the pipeline is a draft law aimed at banning the trade , but a powerful lobby bent on preserving it is trying to ensure it allows kidney donations for a non-relative , with no payment . such a clause allowing `` altruistic '' organ donations will ensure the trade continues with secret payment to donors , naqvi said . stories of people selling their organs , especially kidneys , are not uncommon in egypt , where more than 30 percent of a population of more than 73 million people live below the poverty line . karam , who asked to be identified only by his first name because organ trading is illegal , said it took him only 15 days to secure a kidney for his sister who was suffering from kidney failure . he said a doctor found him a man willing to sell his kidney for 30,000 egyptian pounds -lrb- $ 5,300 -rrb- . `` the fees of the doctor were 5,000 pounds . both his money and the fees of the hospital were deducted from the money the ` donor ' received , '' said karam . he said doctors usually help in finding people willing to sell their organs from their patients ' lists . abdel-kader hegazy , head of the disciplinary committee at the doctors ' union , said egyptian law lacks clear punishment for those involved in illegal transplants , making it easy for doctors to repeat the offence . `` the law says it is illegal to trade in organs but does not specify the punishment . we at the union suspended many doctors and closed their practices , but they have appealed before courts and won their licenses back , '' he told reuters . `` it is an annoying and a regrettable situation . well-known doctors and professors are doing this . they are rich people but they do it because they have no moral values . '' the union has been pushing for legislation to regulate organ transplants , with a draft bill including heavy fines and a prison sentence for those involved and a ban on transplants between people of different nationalities . but the draft law has been languishing in parliament for several years because of differences between doctors and senior muslim religious leaders on whether islam allows organ transplants in the case of clinical deaths . in turkey , students , unemployed young men and struggling fathers post adverts on the internet selling their kidneys , listing their drinking and smoking habits and blood type . these would-be donors say they have had enquiries from germany , israel and turkey with asking prices going up to 50,000 lira -lrb- $ 38,760 -rrb- . hakan , a 27-year-old security guard in istanbul with two young children who also requested only his first name be published , told reuters he received five or six offers from turkey and germany , offering 10,000-15 ,000 lira -lrb- $ 11,600 -rrb- , but he 's holding out for 40,000 lira . `` of course it 's frightening but there 's nothing else to be done , '' he said , adding he had n't told his wife as he knew she would object . `` i 'm doing it because of my family , if i was alone it would n't matter . i 've got two children ... there 's nothing else i can do for them .

'' the scene is an old people 's home . two residents are playing beggar my neighbor . enter the princess . the question from the royal visitor is unexpected but everyone laughs . afterwards they comment on her large eyes and what life she brought into the room . one tiny incident , characteristic of countless other occasions in the princess 's public life in which she found the right word or the right gesture to bring cheer and comfort . everyone here will have their own memories . i remember meeting princess diana for the very first time early in 1981 to discuss details of the wedding service in st paul 's . even archbishop 's chaplains have their share of proper diffidence and i was nervous entering the presence . it must have been a bewildering time for the princess as well , but even then , at the age of 20 , her capacity for empathy and her very strong intuitive power ensured that any tension soon evaporated . prince harry has spoken movingly and justly , as few others have the right to do , about the princess as a mother . i want to dwell for a moment on her public work , its cost and its meaning . after her marriage , the princess joined her natural gifts of beauty , empathy and powerful intuition with that extraordinary charge which association with the royal family generates . led by our queen and other members of the royal family , our constitution has developed in response to the challenges of the past century . there is a properly political sphere in which the monarch may counsel but does n't intrude , but there is another sphere , vital to any sense of national unity and creativity , a sphere in which communities must be celebrated , common values articulated and the transcendent source of those values honored . we tend to be suspicious of public figures who wrap themselves in divinity and claim that their will is god 's will , but if no-one can articulate in an un-ignorable way in the public realm the creative energy of the love that we see in christ , the human face of god , then we shall find ourselves inhabiting a maimed and diminished society . and at a time when people are suspicious of rhetoric , the monarchy communicates by symbol and by simple speech , and the princess brought her own gifts to this work . she was still only 26 in 1987 when she shook the hand of a patient at the opening of the middlesex hospital 's aids ward . it was the first in the uk and it is very hard now to credit the degree of fear and prejudice which surrounded aids in the '80s . those familiar with the field have no doubt that the princess played a significant part in overcoming a harmful and even a cruel taboo in a gesture which was not choreographed but sprung from a deep identification with those who were vulnerable and on the margin . and she had a similar impact in the usa . an editorial in the new york times in 1989 admitted ruefully that it had taken a foreign , and even a royal , dignitary to draw attention to a major public health concern in the us . her work in the very last year of her life for the victims of landmines also caught the popular imagination internationally and certainly accelerated the adoption of the ottawa convention , banning the use of a weapon which disproportionately kills and maims women and children . she proved the eloquence of embrace and of touch which , of course , have been used by royal healers throughout the centuries . and as she said , in her words , `` the biggest disease today is not leprosy or tb but the feeling of being unwanted '' . she sought out places of suffering , because they are so very often places of truth where the masks have been removed , and she was not afraid to be with the dying and to comfort them in an unsentimental way . bill deedes accompanied her on some of her visits . his response to the cynics was typically robust . he said : `` she was one who sought above all to help vulnerable people in society and who did it so well . she was good at this because she herself was vulnerable . she knew the feeling . she did n't set out to be a saint . '' the role brought great power but , like any member of the royal family , she also experienced the weight of expectation and the intensity of the scrutiny . honoring but managing the role and not allowing it to take over one 's personal humanity is a desperately difficult task . as we have heard from prince harry , his mother diana did all that she could to prepare her sons for the work which lies ahead . she confessed to receiving a very great deal from some of those whose lives she touched . she said of john , a young greek suffering from cystic fibrosis : `` he showed no sign of anger , no trace of bitterness but touched us all with an aura of optimism and hope for the future such that i have never before encountered . '' the love of christ described in the lesson read by prince william contains the essence of the spiritual life . princess diana recognized this quality of life in many of those , like john , whose lives she touched . it was a mystery which resonated deeply with her and for which she reached out . and the mystery is this - the more you go beyond yourself , the more you will become your true self ; the more you lose yourself in loving and serving others , the more you will find yourself ; the more you keep company with those who suffer , the more you will be healed . this is the knowledge which passes all understanding . this is certain and has been proved experimentally in the life of all the saints . it 's easy to lose the real person in the image , to insist that all is darkness or all is light . still , 10 years after her tragic death , there are regular reports of `` fury '' at this or that incident , and the princess 's memory is used for scoring points . let it end here . let this service mark the point at which we let her rest in peace and dwell on her memory with thanksgiving and compassion . let us also , echoing the words of prince harry , look to the future and pray , in the words of st paul , for all those who serve our country as members of the royal family and most especially for the sons who were so precious to her : . `` i pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power with all the saints to grasp what is the breadth and length and depth and height of the love of christ and to know this love which surpasses knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of god .

'' `` he said the facts were fudged , '' moore said , referring to gupta , on cnn 's `` larry king live . '' `` that 's a lie . none of the facts are fudged . '' moore and gupta shouted and argued over data gupta used and data moore used . moore said his staffers backed up the film 's facts to gupta before the report aired and that gupta aired it knowing his facts were wrong . gupta disputed that . watch moore , gupta make their points '' `` we try and look for some of the best sources we can possibly find , '' he said . `` michael has a lot of different numbers . ... you 're sort of cherry-picking data from different reports . '' both agreed , however , on the basic premise of `` sicko '' : problems abound in america 's health-care system and need to be fixed . `` i thought it was a good movie , and i wanted to say that , '' gupta said . `` i think it strikes at the irrefutable fact -- it 's broken . we get it . '' he praised moore for raising awareness of the issue . however , gupta said he was concerned that the movie -- which notes that other developed nations such as france and canada have universal health care -- suggests that health care in those countries is free . while patients may not pay for services at the doctor 's office , they do pay high taxes to fund such a system , something gupta said he was concerned that `` sicko '' audiences might not realize . moore responded by saying americans pay more in copays , deductibles and insurance premiums . `` we -lsb- america -rsb- have a system built on profit , '' the moviemaker said . he asked gupta if the current system , which requires him to receive approval from an insurance company before performing some procedures , is cumbersome to him . `` it 's a shameful system , especially when i 'm dealing with some of my patients , '' gupta said . but he questioned moore 's apparent solution -- putting health care in the hands of the bush administration , which moore fiercely criticized in the past , particularly in his film `` fahrenheit 9/11 .

'' `` what we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries , and through the general election , is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates , '' he said . with 17 democratic and republican candidates running for president , cmag predicts that more than $ 800 million will be spent on tv ads in the battle for the white house . up to now , the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of iowa , new hampshire and south carolina . voters in some of the 20-plus states holding nominating contests on february 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months . former massachusetts gov. mitt romney leads all candidates in tv spending , having aired his commercials more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly $ 8.6 million . this is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle . watch how romney is way ahead in ad spending '' in contrast , one of romney 's chief rivals for the gop nomination , former new york mayor rudy giuliani , has spent nothing on television ads , but giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys . giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition , while romney does not . in the race for the democratic nomination , illinois sen. barack obama has spent more than $ 2.3 million on television commercials , while new york sen. hillary clinton has spent $ 1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls . new mexico gov. bill richardson has probably benefited the most in the democratic contest from the $ 2 million he has invested in his television commercials . richardson 's humorous tv ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker , diplomat and executive , and positioned him as a solid second-tier candidate . romney used his $ 8.6 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to republican voters . these voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal massachusetts . romney is leading polls in the early voting states of iowa and new hampshire . further evidence of how romney 's television commercials have helped is in south carolina . an american research group poll of south carolina republicans in august showed romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters . a month later , and with $ 350,000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll , romney was up 17 percentage points . romney 's latest ad began airing friday in iowa , and in it he vows to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons , to boost the military by 100,000 people , to strengthen u.s. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the u.s. from al qaeda . all of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the iowa caucuses . while only a handful of democratic candidates and romney have used the airwaves until now , tracey said he expects this to change . `` before the end of october , i suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air , '' tracey said . `` as we get closer to primary day , the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last , best shot . '' in the fight for congress , cmag predicts that as much as $ 639 million could be spent on television advertising . democrats control the house and senate . tracey noted that cmag 's 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former florida rep. mark foley 's house page scandal or the september 11 terrorist attacks . `` politics is completely beholden to events , '' he said . `` events will ultimately determine how much is spent , where and when . '' what television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months ? `` chances are , just as what happened in 2006 , voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads , '' said stuart rothenberg , editor of the non-partisan rothenberg political report . `` the sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance . after a while , the ads just become lots of chatter and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise .

<s> earth has warmed one degree in past 100 years . </s> <s> majority of scientists say greenhouse gases are causing temperatures to rise . </s> <s> some critics say planets often in periods of warming or cooling . </s><sec>-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- explorer dennis schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near greenland . fishermen pass by greenland 's ilulissat fjord in this september 2004 picture . such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity , even wonder perhaps , but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer . the island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier . but such a large amount of ice melted , it revealed the distinct island . `` i very quickly realized two things , '' he told cnn 's anderson cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year . `` one -lsb- was -rsb- that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change . '' `` the other thing was that it meant it was really happening . it was n't a joke . it was n't just statistics . it was really happening . '' he calls his discovery warming island . many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the earth 's climate are the result of an increase in the world 's temperature , a trend widely called global warming . many global warming experts say the phenomenon , if unchecked , is capable of altering the world 's climate and geography . in the worst-case scenario , experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels , flooding cities and altering seashores . other scientists and observers , a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous , say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet 's life . most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere . but why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious . the earth 's temperature averages about 60 degrees fahrenheit -lrb- about 16 degrees celsius -rrb- . the average surface temperature has warmed one degree fahrenheit -lrb- 0.6 degrees celsius -rrb- during the last century , according to the national research council . the temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910 , according to the u.s. environmental protection agency . they rose till about 1945 , cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day . there are several possible reasons for the warming , scientists say . a change in the earth 's orbit or the intensity of the sun 's radiation could change , triggering warming or cooling . the reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases , which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet 's temperature at a comfortable level . the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , for instance , has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age , according to the united nations ' intergovernmental panel on climate change , commonly referred to as the ipcc . the presence of methane is now 151 percent above pre-industrial levels , but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades , according to the epa . meanwhile , nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years . many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities , like the burning of fossil fuels , emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests . `` for the last 30 years , there 's no way there 's anything natural that can explain it , '' stephen schneider , a professor of environmental studies at stanford university in california , said . `` a vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community ... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming , '' he added . many scientific organizations share schneider 's view , ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the g8 to the national research council , the american meteorological society and the american geophysical union . but there are those who do not share his view , and among the skeptics is richard lindzen , a professor of atmospheric sciences at the massachusetts institute of technology . `` we 've suddenly taken to reading tea leaves , '' he said . `` when we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970 , we were proclaiming global cooling . since then , there 's been a few tenths of global warming , so we 're proclaiming global warming . '' he believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability , where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal . `` the earth is always getting colder and warmer , '' he said . `` it 's always changing . in fact , this is true of any fluid-covered planet . '' asked about glacial melt , which many observers point to as evidence of global warming , lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained . `` we do n't know why , but it 's perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that they 've occurred , '' he said . `` what we 're doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying that 's occurring due to global warming . '' yet , for schneider , it is a cause for concern and alarm . `` we 're already in serious melt , nobody can explain it . the models do n't predict it , '' he said . `` we do n't know what 's going on up there . all we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty . '' the greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the world 's nations . the ipcc in february 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to pre-industrial levels , temperatures could rise between 3.6 to 8.1 degrees fahrenheit -lrb- 2 to 4.5 degrees celsius -rrb- by 2100 . the lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes , droughts , wildfires and flooding , schneider said . the higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of hollywood filmmakers . uncertainties , however , plague such forecasts , which are based on computer simulations and models . the models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere , oceans and continents interact , all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them . `` exactly how much it 's going to warm up , we do n't know , '' schneider said . `` that it 's going to warm up ? i 'd bet anything on that .

'' schumer said that in a meeting friday the nominee said that congress would be within its rights to pass a law that bans waterboarding across all government agencies and that the president `` would have absolutely no legal authority to ignore '' it . schumer said he believed mukasey would be more likely to find waterboarding illegal than an interim attorney general . `` indeed , his written answers to our notices have demonstrated more openness to ending the practices we abhor than either of this president 's previous attorney general nominees have . '' but mukasey 's pledge to enforce such a law rang hollow with sen. patrick leahy , d-vermont , the judiciary committee 's chairman . `` some have sought to find comfort in judge mukasey 's personal assurance that he would enforce a future , new law against waterboarding if this congress were to pass one , '' leahy said tuesday . `` unsaid , of course , is the fact that any such prohibition would have to be enacted over the veto of this president . '' however , the committee 's ranking republican , sen. arlen specter of pennsylvania , said he believed mukasey would enforce a law banning waterboarding . `` he could have said a lot of things which would have given me more assurances , '' specter said earlier . `` but he is intelligent ; he 's really learned in the law . he 's strong , ethical , honest beyond any question . he 's not an intimate of the president . '' a majority of americans consider waterboarding a form of torture , but some of those say it 's ok for the u.s. government to use the technique , according to a poll released tuesday . asked whether they think waterboarding is a form of torture , more than two-thirds of respondents , or 69 percent , said yes ; 29 percent said no . asked whether they think the u.s. government should be allowed to use the procedure to try to get information from suspected terrorists , 58 percent said no ; 40 percent said yes . the cnn/opinion research corp. telephone poll of 1,024 american adults was carried out over the weekend and had a sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points . e-mail to a friend .

'' witnesses put the death toll from the day 's clashes at 19 , including ethiopian troops , insurgents and civilians . ethiopian troops arrived in somalia in december 2006 to help a weak somali government drive the islamic courts union out of mogadishu and restore a u.n.-backed transitional government after a decade and a half of near-anarchy . the islamists responded by launching an insurgency against somali government and ethiopian troops that has lasted nearly a year . the united states accused the icu of harboring suspected al qaeda figures , including three men wanted in the 1998 bombings of u.s. embassies in tanzania and kenya , and raised no objections to ethiopian presence in somalia . washington has long been concerned that somalia could turn into a safe haven for terrorists , but icu leaders denied harboring al qaeda suspects . e-mail to a friend .

'' the second incident involved a child who vomited , fell into a coma and was hospitalized for five days . it was not immediately clear whether the child had made a full recovery . toronto-based toy distributor spin master ltd. stopped shipping the aqua dots toys and asked retailers to pull them off their shelves , where they were previously sold for $ 17 to $ 30 . anyone with aqua dots at home should return the product to the company , cpsc spokeswoman julie vallese said . the toy had been named toy of the year in australia and recently crested wal-mart 's list of top 12 christmas toys . wal-mart on thursday listed the toys on its web site as `` out of stock online '' and had removed them from their top toy list as well . this latest recall is part of a larger batch of recalls of chinese-made toys that have swept across the country . last month alone , u.s. government safety officials and retailers voluntarily recalled at least 69,000 chinese-made toys over concerns of excessive amounts of lead paint , which can cause hazardous lead poisoning . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's janine brady , jason carroll , laura dolan , julie o'neill and leslie wiggins contributed to this report .

'' that kind of attitude appeals to people who are mystified by the arcane lexicon of traditional wine journals or turned off by what they perceive as elitist barriers . across the internet , budding wine geeks are discovering a burgeoning number of web sites , blogs , bulletin boards and other outlets that preach the gospel of the grape in terms they can understand . about 40,000 internet viewers -- many of them 20-somethings -- have a daily appointment with `` wine library tv . '' the low-budget video blog is produced five days a week from a nondescript office in the three-level wine retail operation that vaynerchuk 's family owns in springfield , new jersey . vaynerchuk has a discerning nose and palate , and he does n't dumb down his subject . yet he stuffs his patter with sports and pop-culture references -- and the kind of language a wine spectator critic would be unlikely to employ . the mission of wine sites like `` wine library tv , '' say several of the people behind these new outlets , is to demystify wine -lrb- and in some cases , sell it , too -rrb- . using the language , attitude and new media that appeal to a young , tech-savvy generation , they advocate trusting one 's own palate rather than obeying powerful wine critics . some of the sites also provide opportunities for average wine drinkers to share their opinions . one site , savoreachglass.com , declares its dedication to `` exploring the spirit of wine for a new generation , '' with reviews , online journals and essays that explain the finer points of winemaking -- all with attitude . `` the -lrb- wine -rrb- establishment is about ratings and ` reputation , ' '' says the site 's founder , tynan szvetecz , 29 . `` it 's about collecting the ` good ' stuff as defined by someone else 's palate and tastes . that bores a younger generation .

<s> italy win 2-1 in scotland to secure their qualification for the euro 2008 finals . </s> <s> the result means scotland can not qualify and will now finish third in group b . </s> <s> france will also be reaching the euro 2008 finals after the result in glasgow . </s><sec>glasgow , scotland -- world champions italy clinched qualification for euro 2008 after goals in the first and last minutes gave them a pulsating 2-1 victory at hampden park -- killing off scotland 's hopes of reaching the finals . luca toni celebrates his early goal as italy won 2-1 in scotland to clinch qualification from group b. luca toni shot italy in front but scotland recovered to dominate and barry ferguson bundled home a 65th-minute leveller . however , christian panucci headed an injury-time winner after a controversial decision to award italy a free-kick . the result also means france have sealed qualification , along with italy , from group b without playing a game . in a match played in torrential rain , italy enjoyed the best possible start by taking the lead after just 70 seconds . gianluca zambrotta spotted antonio di natale unmarked in the box , and picked him out with a throw-in as scotland were caught napping . di natale swept the ball into the path of toni who delicately flicked into the top left corner from six meters out . the home side almost conceded a second goal 60 seconds later . this time , toni turned provider and his cut-back was met by mauro camoranesi who fired over from close-range . toni then shrugged off two challenges before drawing a decent save from craig gordon with a well-struck effort that the goalkeeper did well to block at the near post . at the other end , scotland were denied the opportunity to haul themselves back into the match when a thunderous drive from lee mcculloch appeared to be handled by zambrotta inside the area but penalty claims were ignored . spurred on by a sense of injustice , the hosts cranked up the pressure on their visitors . ferguson fired over from a james mcfadden corner , before alan hutton nodded agonisingly wide of the upright following another perfect delivery from the everton man . scotland then produced some wonderful passing football , which culminated in a tight-angled drive from ferguson , but gianluigi buffon dived low to smother . then came another scare for the home side . gordon was forced to pull a save out of the top drawer to deny a point-blank effort from massimo ambrosini , before di natale rifled the rebound into the back of the net . the assistant referee raised his flag for offside but television replays suggested the official may have called it wrong . only last-gasp defending from the italians prevented the scots from grabbing a morale-boosting leveller on the stroke of half-time . david weir rose above everyone else in a packed box to meet ferguson 's corner and his header appeared to be heading for the top corner before andrea pirlo somehow managed to nod off the line . a free-kick in a dangerous area provided italy with the chance to start the second half as emphatically as they had started the first when paul hartley hauled down camoranesi just outside the box . pirlo seized on the chance and looped the ball over the wall but , despite a reputation as a dead-ball specialist , his effort was easily dealt with by gordon . instead , it was scotland who found the back of the net as hampden erupted with 65 minutes gone . mcfadden 's free-kick deflected into the path of mcculloch in front of goal . he was denied by buffon , but the rebound fell kindly to ferguson and the captain gratefully rifled home from close-range . with just over 15 minutes to go , scott brown was withdrawn for kenny miller as scotland went for broke . the derby striker quickly began to cause the italians problems and delivered a wonderful diagonal cross to the feet of mcfadden but he fired wide when it looked easier score . scotland 's impossible dream ended in the cruellest possible way when italy snatched a last minute goal to secure their own qualification for euro 2008 . hutton appeared to be barged over in front of the corner flag but the referee inexplicably awarded the free-kick the other way and panucci rose to meet pirlo 's cross and nod home the winner . italy coach roberto donadoni said : `` we knew it was going to be a physical match given the atmosphere . `` but through their character and desire , the lads were fantastic . they worked so hard , they deserve this . qualifying for euro 2008 is amazing . it 's something positive after all that happened last week -lrb- the death of the lazio fan -rrb- . '' captain fabio cannavaro : `` this was a victory won with the heart . it was difficult to play in this stadium , with that atmosphere it was like a cauldron . `` we played really well and managed to win . we showed once again that we are a strong and compact team and when we need to win we do everything to show that we are the world champions . `` in italy we play a high level of football , we 've won the champions league and the world cup but unfortunately at this moment we are being noticed for something else .

'' so goes the backhanded optimism of the national museum of funeral history , a houston facility that opened in 1992 . visitors are treated to exhibits that include a civil war embalming display and a replica of a turn-of-the-century casket factory . in addition , the museum boasts an exhibit of `` fantasy coffins '' designed by ghanaian artist kane quaye . these moribund masterpieces include a casket shaped like a chicken , a mercedes-benz , a shallot , and an outboard motor . according to quaye , his creations are based on the dreams and last wishes of his clients , which -- let 's be honest -- really makes you wonder about the guy buried in the shallot . 3 . the hobo museum . if you 're bumming around but looking for a good time , be sure to take a load off in britt , iowa , at the hobo museum , which details the history and culture of tramps . bear in mind , though , that the museum kind of , well , slacks on hours and is only open to the public during the annual hobo convention . luckily , tours can be arranged by appointment any time of year . of course , if you 're interested in the hobo convention , lodging is available all over the area , but it 's a safe bet that most of your compatriots will be resting their floppy hats at the `` hobo jungle , '' located by the railroad tracks . both the event and the museum are operated by the hobo foundation , which -- incidentally -- also oversees the nearby hobo cemetery , where those who have `` caught the westbound '' are laid to rest . 4 . the mütter museum . originally , the college of physicians of philadelphia erected the mütter museum as a creative way to inform medical students and practicing physicians about some of the more unusual medical phenomena . -lrb- you know , babies with two heads , that sort of thing . -rrb- . but today , it primarily serves as a popular spot for anyone interested in the grotesque . there , you 'll find the world 's largest colon , removed from a man who died -- not surprisingly -- of constipation . also on display : an ob-gyn instrument collection , thousands of fluid-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens , and a large wall dedicated entirely to swallowed objects . 5 . the barnum museum . what better way to honor `` greatest show on earth '' founder p.t. barnum than with a mediocre museum in bridgeport , connecticut ? some visitors will appreciate the museum 's ridiculously detailed miniature model of a five-ring circus . but only circus freaks -lrb- and by that we mean `` enthusiasts '' -rrb- will get a kick out of seeing a stale piece of cake from the wedding of barnum 's 40-inch-tall sidekick , general tom thumb . 6 . the conspiracy museum . there 's more than one theory about the assassination of john f. kennedy , so why not have more than one museum devoted to it as well ? most jfk buffs are familiar with the sixth floor museum housed in the former texas school book depository , which recounts all those boring `` mainstream '' details of the late president 's life leading up to his death at the hands of lee harvey oswald . but just down the street , the conspiracy museum offers fodder for those less apt to buy into the man 's propaganda . for the most part , the museum specializes in showings of the zapruder film and explanations of contrary assassination theories , including other gunmen on the grassy knoll and possible mafia involvement . 7 . the museum of questionable medical devices . take two trips to the museum of questionable medical devices and call us when you 've lost all faith in the medical profession . thanks to curator bob mccoy -lrb- who recently donated the collection to the science museum of minnesota -rrb- , those in search of history 's quack science can find what they 're looking for in the st. paul tourist attraction , whether it 's a collection of 19th-century phrenology machines or some 1970s breast enlargers . if you make the trip , be sure to check out the 1930s mcgregor rejuvenator . this clever device required patrons to enclose their bodies , sans head , in a large tube where they were pounded with magnetic and radio waves in attempts to reverse the aging process . 8 . cook 's natural science museum . what began as a training facility for cook 's pest control exterminators blossomed into one of the few museums in the country willing to tell the tale of the pest . at cook 's natural science museum in decatur , alabama , visitors can learn everything they ever wanted to know about rats , cockroaches , mice , spiders , and termites ... all for free . and while most people would rather step on the live specimens than learn about them , museum exhibits such as the crowd-pleasing pest of the month keep reeling in patrons . 9 . vent haven ventriloquist museum . so , what do you get when you combine the loneliness of a pet cemetery with the creepy flair of vaudeville ? the vent haven ventriloquist museum , of course -- where dummies go to die . the fort mitchell , kentucky , museum was the brainchild of the late william shakespeare berger , who founded the site as a home for retired wooden puppets . in fact , he collected figures from some of the country 's most famous ventriloquist acts . and with more than 700 dummies stacked from floor to ceiling , you 're bound to feel like you 're stuck inside a 1970s horror flick -- albeit a really good one . but sadly , when berger gave the tour , you could totally tell his mouth was moving . 10 . the trash museum . mom was n't kidding when she said one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . at the trash museum in hartford , connecticut , the connecticut resources recovery authority -lrb- crra -rrb- turns garbage into 6,500 square feet of pure recycling entertainment ! t . our the temple of trash or visit the old-fashioned town dump . and for your recycler-in-training , head across the state to the children 's garbage museum , where you can take an educational stroll through the giant compost pile , get a glimpse of the 1-ton trash-o-saurus , or enjoy the company of resident compost worms . e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .

'' concerned citizens have helped troops improve security in parts of baghdad , a military official says . people line the streets , cars congest them , trash collectors and other city workers have returned , local leaders are holding community meetings again and `` markets have come back like gangbusters , '' said army col. don farris , commander of 2nd brigade combat team , 82nd airborne division . he added that the largely sunni al qaeda in iraq presence has been `` crushed '' since the beginning of may . however , there are still dangers , most notably the threats posed by iranian-backed shiite militants , farris said . speaking to pentagon reporters via video link from baghdad , farris cited several factors he said contributed to the improving security situation . among them is the `` surge , '' the additional u.s. troops deployed earlier this year . watch how old rivalries have been posing problems '' also helping improve the security situation are the cease-fire by radical shiite cleric muqtada al-sadr 's mehdi army and the development of a program that employs `` concerned local citizens '' to assist u.s. and iraqi forces , farris said . some of those citizens are members of local sunni `` awakening councils , '' comprised of former militants -- often armed -- who create neighborhood watch groups to root out the insurgent elements in an area . especially in the last six weeks , farris said , civic and religious leaders have seen outsiders operating in the area and troops have made arrests , two iranian operatives among them . `` from my foxhole , in our sector , it is working , '' he said of the improving security in the area . `` i can only speak to what i see in my sector and i am encouraged . '' farris ' sector -- which includes the sunni-dominated district of adhamiya and sadr city , the shiite slum where militants have demonstrated a strong presence -- has seen a `` remarkable turnaround , '' he said . many of the communities in his area have been wracked with sectarian warfare and terrorized by insurgents and death squads . despite improvements in the security situation , farris warned that `` we still have a lot of work to do '' because there does n't appear to be any sign that shiite extremists with links to iran are halting their activities . farris said troops also are still finding explosively formed penetrators , which are often delivered or manufactured by iran . nine such bombs were found in late october , he said . there are intelligence reports indicating weapons and money are still flowing into sadr city , he said . there are also problems returning refugees and displaced people to their homes in the area , farris said , because `` essential services '' like water and electricity are not yet up to snuff . though a `` trickle '' of families has returned home and many are asking when they can return , farris said he believes residents will return en masse only when basic services are in better shape . paul folmsbee , a state department provincial reconstruction team leader , said at the same news conference that his personnel was handling development issues involving law , governance , economic development and essential services . farris ' monday remarks echo a string of similar assertions made by u.s. and iraqi military officials over recent weeks . the military officials say they are seeing signs of sunni-shiite reconciliation . at a press conference earlier monday in baghdad , brig. gen. ed cardon , deputy commander for support of multi-national division-center , discussed a `` definite period of progress '' in his region on the southern baghdad outskirts . e-mail to a friend .

'' so , just how much did rand believe in her own philosophy ? let 's just say a lot . with signature modesty , she ranked herself as the philosophical equal of aristotle and thomas aquinas . orson welles . when you create a cinematic masterpiece such as `` citizen kane '' at the ripe old age of 25 , you 're bound to get a big head . but welles was convinced of his own importance much earlier than that . in fact , `` citizen kane '' might have been sparked by nothing more than a bruised ego . after all , it 's said he devised the film as a withering exposé of newspaper mogul william randolph hearst because hearst slighted welles at a dinner party . of course , after the unparalleled success of `` citizen kane , '' welles 's arrogant side did n't get any less subtle . do yourself a favor : track down a recording of welles ' outtakes for a tv commercial for frozen peas . you 'll hear everything you need to know about the filmmaker 's oversized ego . a classic quote goes : `` in the depths of your ignorance , what is it you want ? '' frank lloyd wright . as the brains behind the robie house , fallingwater , taliesin west , the guggenheim , and countless other design benchmarks , frank lloyd wright is arguably the genius of 20th-century architecture . and , boy , did he know it ! wright was notorious for believing he was superior to mere mortals . in fact , the architectural egomaniac frequently acted as though the rules -- even those of geography and climate -- did not apply to him . but when you 're wright , you 're right . in 1935 , department store magnate stanley marcus -lrb- of neiman-marcus fame -rrb- commissioned the architect to design his dallas home , but the project quickly went sour . wright 's avant-garde floor plan included `` sleeping porches '' that required his client to sleep outdoors year-round . in addition , marcus ' small bedroom `` cubicles '' came equipped with almost no closet space . when stanley respectfully explained that -lrb- a -rrb- temperatures during summer nights in dallas often exceed 80 degrees and -lrb- b -rrb- a high-fashion tastemaker might need bigger closets , wright threw a series of tantrums . fortunately for the voyeur in us all , said tantrums usually took place in letter form . preserved and occasionally displayed at the dallas museum of art , they make for delicious reading . salvador dalí . `` every morning when i awake , the greatest of joys is mine : that of being salvador dalí .

'' but al jolson really , really believed it . the vaudeville singer , actor , dancer , and comedian was born asa yoelson in seredzius , lithuania , in what was then part of imperial russia . as a performer , he was known for hijacking the action in the middle of shows , ad-libbing , or just stopping to talk to the audience . during a 1911 performance of the critically hated `` paris is a paradise for coons '' -lrb- title not edited for political correctness -rrb- , jolson stopped and asked the audience if they 'd rather hear him sing than see the rest of the play . the crowd roared with applause , and jolson ditched the whole program and took over . from that moment on , no one else could share the stage with him . unlike some of the egomaniacs on this list , however , jolson can be forgiven somewhat for his arrogance . according to most contemporary accounts , he actually was the greatest in the world . but , despite the enormity of his contributions to stage and screen , jolson 's legacy has become a political hot potato because of his use of stage blackface -lrb- considered highly offensive now , but pretty common at the time -rrb- . e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .

'' it 's the perception that the country is becoming more hispanic , that spanish is replacing english , that hispanic immigrants are weakening american identity , and that main street is turning into little mexico . a leader of the vigilante minuteman movement moronically called it the `` colonization '' of the united states . this sort of rhetoric is all about fear -- that those who thrive in the dominant culture are losing their primacy , that the mainstream is being polluted by foreigners , and that our children are going to live in a world where they 're going to have to work a lot harder to keep up . it conjures up the alarm bells that benjamin franklin set off about german immigrants in the late 18th century , who he insisted could never adopt the culture of the english , but would `` swarm into our settlements , and by herding together establish their language and manners to the exclusion of ours . '' it popped up in the mid-19th century amid worries that chinese immigrants were `` unassimilable , '' which led to congress approving the explicitly-named chinese exclusion act of 1882 . and it helped welcome the 20th century when massachusetts sen. henry cabot lodge warned that immigrants -lrb- read : the irish -rrb- were diluting `` the quality of -lrb- u.s. -rrb- citizenship '' and others complained that italian immigrants were uneducated , low skilled , apt to send all their money to their home country and prone to criminal activity . where have we heard that before ? and when will we hear it again ? after all , hispanics may be the latest group to find themselves in a culture war with nativists . but they wo n't be the last . ruben navarrette jr. is a member of the editorial board of the san diego union-tribune and a nationally syndicated columnist . you can read his column here . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer . e-mail to a friend .

'' alonso , who qualified for the race in fourth , is seeking to become the third driver to win three world titles . `` the result was good today and the eight points are a help for sure , '' he said . `` i think the championship will still be very difficult because i know it will not be easy to take four points from lewis . `` i need something dramatic if i want to win . with a normal race it will be impossible .

'' jeffs also told his brother : `` farewell forever .

<s> re-designed fuji speedway to host its first japanese grand prix since 1977 . </s> <s> suzuka to alternate with fuji from 2009 . </s> <s> computer models used to prepare teams for the unfamiliar circuit . </s><sec>london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- there are some circuits that are cornerstones of the formula 1 calendar : the monacos and silverstones whose every twist and turn are known intimately by the drivers and engineers . then there are the newer circuits -- malaysia and bahrain , for instance -- but even these have become familiar to the drivers and their backroom boffins . fuji speedway employees pose behind a scale model of the new circuit and in front of an overhead view . next week they have something completely new to contend with : a track that has yet to see a single f1 team put in a single lap . the japan grand prix is to return to the fuji speedway , a circuit that has n't seen an f1 race since 1977 -lrb- though now with a substantially different track layout -rrb- . the fuji circuit will be familiar to fans of classic arcade games . the old fuji speedway was the setting for the 1982 arcade game pole position -lrb- released by namco in japan and atari in the rest of the world -rrb- . the most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of mount fuji , japan 's tallest mountain , looming in the distance . though the move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies . the suzuka track -- which had held japanese grands prix between 1987 and 2006 -- had been popular with drivers and fans alike , but for this year and the next the japanese grand prix will be held at fuji . however an announcement by formula one management -lrb- fom -rrb- this month revealed that suzuka will return to the calendar for 2009 -- on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications -- with the location of the japanese grand prix alternating yearly between fuji and suzuka after that . behind the scenes is a political battleground -- both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with f1 connections -- honda owns suzuka , toyota owns fuji . toyota is a relative newcomer to f1 but , having this year surpassed general motors as the world 's number one automobile manufacturer , and reputedly having the best funded team in the paddock -lrb- a position that has n't been reflected in sporting success -rrb- , it is not without clout . the redesign of the fuji track was carried out by hermann tilke in 2003 . tilke , a german architect redesigned a number of f1 circuits in the 1990s and has since designed many new grand prix tracks including malaysia , istanbul , bahrain and shanghai , and the tracks for 2008 's debut grands prix in singapore and valencia . so how do f1 teams prepare for a new circuit such as fuji without data from previous races to fall back on ? the answer lies with computer simulation . computer-aided design -lrb- cad -rrb- is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is a part of the design of the high-tech cars . every bend , every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an ounce of dirt is shifted on the ground itself . despite never having raced on the circuit , the teams have been testing their cars on a virtual fuji speedway for some time . bmw sauber 's simulation experts received cad data from the japanese race organizers late last year . and when their cars arrive at fuji for testing next week , their race set-up should be close to optimum . the circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments . the radius of each individual segment was measured , allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line -lrb- the route around the circuit that covers the shortest possible distance -rrb- . then the effects of factors such as gradients and inclines were calculated . the slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car . `` in order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend , we need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels , gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance , '' says willy rampf , technical director of the bmw sauber f1 team . dieter glass , chief race and test engineer with toyota f1 explains : . `` you start to determine what downforce level gives the best lap time on the new circuit . once you know that , you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce , before you get into more detailed simulations of different set-up solutions . `` getting a bit closer to the weekend , you start running race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy . this prediction takes into account estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track , like the degradation of the two bridgestone tire compounds and the effect the fuel has on lap time . if you have more fuel in the car , this affects your lap time , but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried . '' one peculiarity of the fuji circuit is the exceptionally long main straight , which at 1.475 km -lrb- 0.916 miles -rrb- will allow for higher-than average-straight line speeds but , after the straight the track is relatively twisty . the teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight , and the best grip decelerating into the bends . `` you have some very slow corners which require good mechanical grip , '' says glass , `` and as always you want good grip in general , but you have to balance that with the long straight , where you need low enough downforce to get a level of drag which allows you to have a good top speed . '' the testing may be virtual , but the teams hope that these virtual figures are a hair 's breadth away from real world eventualities : . `` our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values , '' says rampf . not that everything can be predicted : `` i think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race , '' continues glass . `` many incidents can happen , which then have a positive or an adverse affect on strategy .

'' `` this is a bipartisan bill supported by over 50 republicans , '' obey , d-wisconsin , said in a statement issued after the veto . `` there has been virtually no criticism of its contents . it is clear the only reason the president vetoed this bill is pure politics . '' bush said democrats are supporting $ 22 billion in additional spending beyond his budget proposals this year and $ 205 billion over five years -- money he said would ultimately be raised by tax increases . `` when the bill for all that spending comes due , congress is going to turn to the working people , to the small-business owners and the entrepreneurs , '' he said . tuesday 's veto is the fifth cast since democrats took control of congress in 2006 . congress has overridden one of those , voting last week to authorize $ 23 billion in water projects nationwide over the president 's objections . democrats will schedule another override vote this week , an aide to house majority leader steny hoyer said . but antonia ferrier , spokeswoman for house republican whip roy blunt , said bush 's gop allies are confident they will be able to sustain the veto . bush signed a $ 470 billion pentagon spending bill that covers the defense department 's normal operations , but democrats split $ 50 billion in spending for the wars in iraq and afghanistan off into a `` bridge fund '' to which they plan to attach demands for bush to withdraw u.s. combat troops . the measure sets up another confrontation with the white house . bush also demanded congress reform the alternative minimum tax -- a measure originally aimed at preventing the wealthy from evading taxes , but one that increasingly affects middle-class earners -- without raising additional revenue . he said a plan proposed by rep. charles rangel , the democratic chairman of the house ways and means committee , to eliminate the tax was unacceptable . `` preventing a tax increase in one area should not be an excuse for raising taxes in other areas , '' he said . `` congress should eliminate the tax increases in the bill and send the amt relief to my desk as soon as possible . '' the elimination of the tax would cause an estimated $ 800 billion to be lost over 10 years . to replace that , rangel 's bill would add a 4 percent surtax on individual incomes over $ 100,000 , after deductions , and close corporate tax loopholes . the bill also would cut rates for many individual and corporate taxpayers . republicans have already started calling it `` the mother of all tax increases . '' `` with all the other pressures on our economy , raising taxes is one of the most unwise things congress could possibly do , '' bush said . bush acknowledged the difficulties americans face from high fuel prices , a `` challenged '' housing market and `` uncertainty '' in financial markets stemming from the collapse of the subprime mortgage market -- `` but as we have seen in recent years , this economy is resilient , and that 's important for the american people to understand .

'' mccain said : `` it 's that kind of isolationism that caused world war ii , '' which drew some hoots from the crowd . watch mccain , paul spar on iraq '' paul replied : `` the real question you have to ask is why do i get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel ? '' a retired brigadier general , keith kerr , who is gay , asked candidates if they thought u.s. military personnel were professional enough to work with gay and lesbian troops . cnn later learned that a june media release from the campaign of democratic front-runner clinton listed kerr as a member of its steering committee for gay and lesbian supporters . watch kerr deny that the clinton campaign influenced his question '' david bohrman , cnn senior vice president and executive producer of the debate , said , `` we regret this incident . cnn would not have used the general 's question had we known that he was connected to any presidential candidate . '' political ticker . kerr told cnn after the debate that he has not worked for the clinton campaign and was representing no one other than himself . kerr also said he is a member of the log cabin republicans , a national gay and lesbian republican grass-roots organization . prior to the debate , cnn had verified kerr 's military background and that he had not contributed money to any presidential candidate . in a section of the debate about gun ownership rights , three of the gop presidential hopefuls said they do not own guns : mccain , giuliani and romney . former tennessee sen. fred thompson quipped , `` i own a couple of guns -- but i 'm not going to tell you what they are or where they are . '' watch the candidates address gun control '' the debate turned personal when a viewer , holding the bible , asked : `` do you believe every word of this book ? and i mean specifically , this book that i am holding in my hand . '' huckabee , a baptist minister , said , `` sure , i believe the bible is exactly what it is . '' giuliani said he believes the bible , but not `` literally true in every respect . '' after that , romney stammered a bit when moderator anderson cooper asked him if he believed every word . watch the candidates get personal about the bible '' `` yeah , the bible is the word of god . ... i might interpret the word differently than you interpret the word , but i read the bible and i believe the bible is the word of god , '' romney said . when asked about abortion , romney said he was wrong in favoring a woman 's right to choose -- his position when he was elected governor of massachusetts . `` if people in this country are looking for someone who 's never made a mistake on a policy issue and is not willing to admit they 're ever wrong , they 're going to have to find somebody else . on abortion , i was wrong , '' he said . his remarks came in response to the 30-second video produced for the debate by thompson 's campaign , which included a clip of romney expressing support for roe vs. wade during a 1994 debate against sen. ted kennedy . when asked what women and doctors should be charged with if abortion was to become illegal , paul said it was not an issue for the president or the federal government . `` we do n't need a federal abortion police , that 's the last thing we need , '' paul said . he added that the issue should be left to the states and courts and not federal authorities . on the issues of taxes , thompson said he 'd `` never met a tax he liked . '' `` i 've got a tax-cut bill on the table . but i do n't do pledges to anybody but the american people , '' he said . his response was met by a `` go , fred , go ! '' from a member of the audience . on the issue of trade with china , rep. duncan hunter said china is `` cheating on trade ... and it 's in the interest of the united states to stop china 's cheating . buy american this christmas season -- that might keep your neighbor from losing his job . '' the candidates fielded video questions submitted by the public via the youtube web site , just as democratic white house candidates did in july . the debate was the first time the gop candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month . cnn 's political team viewed nearly 5,000 videos for the gop debate -- about 2,000 more than they saw for the democrats ' debate . e-mail to a friend .
<s> some witnesses say colorado does nothing to protect them . </s> <s> one witness spent over 10,000 dollars on security after being terrorized . </s> <s> community activist says colorado 's witness protection program is `` a joke '' </s><sec>denver , colorado -- a colorado man terrorized by threats after testifying against his daughter 's abusive boyfriend says he has spent $ 10,000 on a security system , hired a bodyguard for his son 's wedding and never leaves home without a .45 - caliber handgun strapped to his chest . keith reynolds was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case . the man , who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case , says the state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of keith reynolds for domestic abuse -- even after prosecutors told him a hit had been put on his family . a report in the denver post pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of colorado . paul logli , chairman of national district attorneys association , told congress this year that witness intimidation has become `` almost epidemic , '' according to the denver post . when asked if prosecutors had made the family aware of colorado 's witness protection program , the witness in the reynolds case said , `` all they told us was maybe we should move . '' `` i 'm pretty sure i told one of them -- either him or his wife -- about the program . i ca n't remember if i gave them all the details . '' the prosecutor assigned to the case , who did n't want to be named , told cnn . after reynolds ' conviction , the witness and his wife saw strange cars parked outside their home . they received phone calls during which the only sound on the other end of the line was a gun being cocked . the couple received a death threat from reynolds himself through the mail . watch witness describe fear of being targeted '' reynolds was then sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison for witness intimidation . however , it is likely he 'll be released within five years . no national statistics on crimes against witnesses exist , and minimal research has been conducted on the subject . the latest national institute of justice survey on record -- conducted more than a decade ago -- shows that more than half of big city prosecutors consider witness intimidation a major problem . colorado has $ 50,000 allocated to its witness protection budget . in contrast , the city of denver spent almost $ 100,000 on landscaping last year . the state , on average , spends about $ 1,000 per witness . that figure supposedly includes moving expenses , rent , and furniture . the federal program spends in excess of $ 40 million per year on witness protection . one possible reason for the disparity is that witnesses in state cases do not get new identities , as do federal witnesses . `` it 's not designed to be a long-term relocation at the public 's expense ; it 's a way to ensure the immediate safety of the witnesses , '' according to peter weir , executive director of the colorado department of public safety . colorado 's witness protection program is a `` joke , '' according to the rev. leon kelly , founder and executive director of the open door youth gang alternatives . kelly says the state does n't provide enough incentive for witnesses to come forward . more than a decade ago , a young man named darryl givens asked kelly for advice while deciding whether to testify in a murder case or face prison . givens chose to testify . a few months later , he was shot twice in the head by men he considered friends . that day continues to haunt kelly . rhonda fields says failures in the witness protection program may have contributed to her son 's murder . javad fields was a college graduate who was engaged to be married . he had plans to move east when a fourth of july barbecue in 2004 in changed all that . he witnessed the murder of his best friend and subsequently testified against three men suspected in the killing . javad fields and his fiancee were gunned down while driving along a suburban street in aurora , colorado . the couple , both 22 , died instantly . rhonda fields says her son was never told about a witness protection program . she confronted prosecutors after his murder . fields told cnn , `` i asked them what happened . why were n't any measures taken to safeguard his life ? and i was told he never asked for any protection . '' javad 's mother does not think it was her son 's responsibility to ask for protection . `` i think it 's the authorities ' responsibility to notify witnesses of the dangers that are involved with being a witness , '' she said . field 's case illustrates glaring weaknesses in the witness protection program . prosecutors filed an order for protection requesting javad fields ' personal information be kept secret , but it was n't signed by a judge until one year later , after defense lawyers had already given the suspects fields ' personal information , along with crucial trial documents . `` i felt like the da 's office used my son to win their case but did not take the proper measures to safeguard his life , '' rhonda fields told cnn . district attorney carol chambers maintains the program has improved . she says a notice about witness protection is now attached to every subpoena , ensuring witnesses are aware of their options . that did n't start , however , until two years after javad fields was killed . e-mail to a friend .

'' `` the president wants clean legislation , a clean bill to fund the veterans , '' perino said . on saturday , the democratic congressional leadership sent a letter to president bush saying they welcomed a dialogue on spending , sayings disagreements over funding levels `` have never been so great that we can not reach agreement on a spending plan that meets the needs of the american people . '' `` key to this dialogue , however , is some willingness on your part to actually find common ground , '' house speaker nancy pelosi , d-california , and senate majority leader harry reid , d-nevada , said in the letter . the leadership said last year 's congress , which was still under republican control , had never passed a separate bill funding veterans programs . congress also sent to the president legislation that would fund veterans care at the levels requested by the president through december 14 , the leadership said . the current funding level `` is still below the $ 3.9 billion extra that we passed , '' said nadeam elshami , spokesman pelosi . `` we are committed to getting the extra funding that the congress already voted on the president 's desk for his signature . '' the leadership blamed republican members of congress for stalling the funding for the veterans programs by blocking its inclusion in the larger spending bill . perino , though , said the democrats could still send a separate bill to the president funding the veterans program that passed both chambers of congress . `` the democrats decided not to send the president this bill , '' perino said . `` that has to be laid at their feet .

'' he said the bush administration , the state department and congress all share blame . speaking with military reporters in virginia , sanchez also said such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court martial , but the politicians have not been held accountable . `` i 'm astounded , really , '' south carolina republican sen. lindsey graham on cnn 's `` late edition '' with wolf blitzer on sunday . graham , who recently returned from baghdad , said he and gop presidential candidate sen. john mccain had visited sanchez several times in 2003 and 2004 . `` every time we talked to gen. sanchez , we got pushback -- we have enough troops ; guard and reserves are n't being strained , '' graham said . he added that sanchez 's own record in iraq is blemished : abu ghraib `` got out of control under his watch . the war in general got out of control under his watch . '' but graham said that `` finally , '' with the commitment of nearly 30,000 additional u.s. troops since january , `` we are getting it right . '' sanchez told reporters that american political leaders have cost american lives on the battlefield with their `` lust for power . '' sanchez said it had been his duty to obey orders and not object publicly while on active duty , but that he has an obligation to speak out now that he has retired . `` while the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their reputations and their political power , our soldiers die , '' he said . that brought a tart response from mccain , the ranking republican on the senate armed services committee . `` i wish that he had given us the benefit of that knowledge at the time , '' mccain told cbs 's `` face the nation . '' he said sanchez should have spoken out at the time -- or resigned -- but `` unfortunately , that does n't happen very often . '' one of the reasons few speak out , he said , is evidenced by what happened to former army chief of staff gen. eric shinseki , mccain said . shinseki was sidelined after telling congress that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to occupy iraq . sen. mitch mcconnell , a republican from kentucky , told abc 's `` this week '' that sanchez is simply wrong . `` my definition of winning is a stable country and an ally in the war on terror , '' he said . `` i think we 're making significant progress toward that end . '' but , he added , `` i think the central government in iraq has been an embarrassment . they 've not been able to produce any of the kind of political compromises that we had hoped for . '' graham said he hopes the government of prime minister nuri al-maliki will `` step up to the plate and do something meaningful by the end of the year . '' if that does not happen , he said , `` it will be incumbent upon us , as a nation , to devise a new political strategy to find a way forward or create a stable iraq . '' that brought a blistering response from zbigniew brzezinski , national security adviser under president carter . `` what is this ? this is a colony , '' he said . `` that 's the heart and essence of the difficulties we encounter . '' even those iraqis who were happy to see saddam hussein toppled from power more than four years ago are not happy with the continuing u.s. presence , brzezinski said . though some countries are willing to go along with the united states , `` no one in the world really supports our policy in iraq , '' he said . in his friday speech , sanchez added that the `` surge '' of u.s. troops into iraq represents `` a desperate attempt by the administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war .
